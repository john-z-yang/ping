# ping

Ping CLI application written in C++ using asio and cxxopts.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have g++ and make, and you are on macOS or Linux.

### Installing

Clone this repository (use the `--recursive` flag as it contains submodules).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dniwrallets/ping.git --recursive
```

Navigate to the root and run make, the final executable (`ping`) will be in the `out` directory.

```bash
make
```

Run the program (note: you may need to be root).

See `--help` for more options

```bash
sudo out/ping google.com
